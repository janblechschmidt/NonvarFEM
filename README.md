# NonvarFEM
This repository contains Python code to solve second-order partial differential equations in nonvariational form using FEniCS.
Currently, the following solvers are implemented:
- Direct solver using a finite element Hessian recovery 
- Iterative solver (using gmres) using a finite element Hessian recovery 
- Direct method by Neilan
- Direct method by Feng, Salgado, Zhang
